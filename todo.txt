Easy to implement:
- Add text about power saving to readme (https://github.com/murderbeard/com.moz.denon/issues/6)
- Make sure conditions.channel always succeeds. What about the second/third zone replies?

Unknown need more info:
- X2400H doesn't work maybe? (https://github.com/murderbeard/com.moz.denon/issues/3)
- Losing connection and false power status (https://github.com/murderbeard/com.moz.denon/issues/10)
- As source is grabbed during regular updates - does the channel condition card NEED to send it's own SI??
- Should source be considered a capability so we can set it through the mobile/web interface?

Harder:
- Zone 2 control via device control (https://github.com/murderbeard/com.moz.denon/issues/5)
- Connection info - tell when device is offline (https://github.com/murderbeard/com.moz.denon/issues/11) From github: add is_available_on_network or disappeared from network.

Investigate Future:
- Investigate if Zone2 as a separate device makes things easier. Or just see if Zone2 is doable.
- investigate zone 2 gui buttons: https://github.com/murderbeard/com.moz.denon/issues/5
- increase default input source list? Custom input source list?


Done:
- (Fixed as of SDK3?) Investigate removal of device for updateDeviceStatus() and other loops that might get stuck running on a garbage removed device.
- (DONE) Sort the device list nicely.
- Investigate Source as part of the status update - adding a source changed event card.
- Add CD to source list - was missing from the beginning. (https://github.com/murderbeard/com.moz.denon/issues/2)
